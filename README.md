# TOAccl
Accelerated topology optimization (TO) methods.
The Inexact Recycled Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Method (IRIRLM) uses the 2D 99-line TO code by Ole Sigmund as the backbone.
3D stress-based TO can be found at: https://github.com/PittAMRL/StressTopOpt (Deng et al. 2021).
The multigrid conjugate gradient (MGCG) method could be found at: https://github.com/odedamir/topopt-mgcg-matlab (Amir et al., 2014 and 2015).
